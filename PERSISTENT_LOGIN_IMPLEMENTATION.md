# Persistent Login Implementation

## Overview
The app now remembers login state and automatically logs users back in when they reopen the app, eliminating the need to sign in every time.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Automatic Token Clearing**
- **Before**: App cleared tokens on every launch for testing
- **After**: App preserves tokens and checks their validity on launch

### 2. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**
- **App Launch**: Checks for valid stored tokens
- **Auto-Login**: If valid token exists, attempts backend authentication
- **Fallback**: If no valid token or auth fails, shows login screen

### 3. **Improved Token Management**
- **Token Validation**: Checks both existence and expiry (24-hour default)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired tokens are automatically cleared
- **Debug Logging**: Better visibility into authentication flow

### 4. **New Splash Screen**
- Shows loading indicator while checking authentication
- Provides smooth transition to either home screen or login

## How It Works

### First Time Login
1. User signs in with Google
2. Token is saved locally with 24-hour expiry
3. User navigates to home screen

### Subsequent App Opens
1. App checks for valid stored token
2. If valid, attempts backend authentication
3. On success: Auto-login to home screen
4. On failure: Clear invalid token and show login

### Token Expiry
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Expired tokens are automatically cleared
- User will need to sign in again after expiry

## Files Modified

### `Talkeys_IOSApp.swift`
- Added authentication check on app launch
- Added splash loading screen
- Removed automatic token clearing
- Added debug methods for manual testing

### `AuthViewModel.swift`
- Enhanced existing auth check with better logging
- Improved error handling for persistent login

### `LandingPage.swift`
- Updated to work with main app authentication flow
- Enhanced TokenManager with better validation
- Added debug methods for testing

## Testing

### To Test Persistent Login:
1. Sign in to the app
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. Should automatically log you back in

### To Test Token Expiry:
1. Sign in to the app
2. Wait 24 hours (or modify expiry time for testing)
3. Reopen the app
4. Should show login screen due to expired token

### Manual Token Clearing (for testing):
```swift
// In Xcode debugger or by adding temporary button:
TokenManager.shared.clearTokensForTesting()
```

## Security Notes

- Tokens are stored in UserDefaults (consider Keychain for production)
- 24-hour expiry provides balance between convenience and security
- Invalid/expired tokens are automatically cleared
- Backend authentication is still required even with valid local token

## Future Enhancements

- Move token storage to Keychain for better security
- Add refresh token mechanism
- Implement biometric authentication option
- Add "Remember Me" toggle for user control
