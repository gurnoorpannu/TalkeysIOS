# Spacing Fixes for Events Screen

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Space Above Event Poster Images**
The slight gap above the "KICK OFF" poster and other event images was caused by improper frame alignment.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `.top` alignment to the card frame: `.frame(width: cardWidth, height: cardHeight, alignment: .top)`
- This ensures the VStack content (including the image) aligns to the top of the card frame
- Eliminates any unwanted spacing above the poster images

### 2. **Added Padding Above First Events Section Heading**
Added proper spacing above the first category heading to improve visual hierarchy.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `.padding(.top, 20)` to the main events LazyVStack
- Updated skeleton loading to match with the same top padding
- Creates consistent spacing between the filter buttons and the first events section

## Files Modified

### `Talkeys IOS/Views/Components/EventCard.swift`
```swift
// Added top alignment to eliminate spacing above images
.frame(width: cardWidth, height: cardHeight, alignment: .top)
```

### `Talkeys IOS/Views/ExploreEventsView.swift`
```swift
// Added top padding to events content
.padding(.top, 20) // Add padding above first heading

// Updated skeleton loading to match
.padding(.top, 20) // Match real content top padding
```

## Visual Result

1. **Clean Event Cards**: No more unwanted space above poster images
2. **Better Spacing**: Proper padding between filter buttons and first events section
3. **Consistent Layout**: Both real content and skeleton loading have matching spacing
4. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between UI sections

## Technical Details

The spacing issue above images was resolved by:
- Using explicit `.top` alignment in the card frame
- Ensuring the VStack content starts exactly at the top edge
- Maintaining the existing corner radius and clipping behavior

The padding above headings provides:
- 20px of space between filter buttons and first category
- Consistent spacing across all screen states (loading, content, empty)
- Better visual breathing room for the content sections
